# Ready, set, Go!

I'm learning about the **[Go](https://golang.org/)** programming language. Google started it's development in 2007 (reaching [1.0](https://blog.golang.org/go-version-1-is-released) in 2012), in an attempt to fill the gaps where Python, Java and C++ have room for improvement. 

Note that it's being designed and implemented by brilliant minds like **[Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson)** and **[Rob Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike)**, between others.

<br>

Go aims to mix some of the best features of modern programming languages (both dynamic and static): friendly, **clear and concise syntax but still statically typed and compiled directly to machine code**, **garbage collection**, **concurrency**, etc. For example, you don't have to necessarily declare the type of a variable, Go uses [type inference](https://tour.golang.org/basics/14) for that.

Full cross-platform support is provided, even for [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) (remember Ken Thompson and Rob Pike are behind the project!), you won't have any problem with that.

It also has some type of object-orientation with functional programming features, but no object hierarchy.
