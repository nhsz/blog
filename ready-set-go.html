          Hi! I'm currently learning about the <strong><a class="link" href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go</a> programming language</strong> and thought it was an interesting topic to start writing in this blog.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Google started <strong>Golang</strong> (as known as <em>Go</em>) development in 2007 (reaching the <a class="link" href="https://blog.golang.org/go-version-1-is-released" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.0 milestone</a> in 2012), in an attempt to fill the gaps where <code>Python</code>, <code>Java</code> and <code>C++</code> have room for improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that it's being designed and implemented by brilliant minds like <strong><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ken Thompson</a></strong> and <strong><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rob Pike</a></strong>, among others.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Go aims to mix some of the best features of modern programming languages (both dynamic and static): friendly, <strong>clear and concise syntax but still statically typed and compiled directly to machine code</strong>, <strong>garbage collection</strong>, <strong>concurrency</strong>, etc. For example, you don't have to necessarily declare the type of a variable, Go uses <a class="link" href="https://tour.golang.org/basics/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type inference</a> for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Full cross-platform support is provided, even for <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plan 9</a> (remember Ken Thompson and Rob Pike are behind the project!), you won't have any problem with that.
          It also has some kind of object-orientation with functional programming features, but no object hierarchy.
        </p>
