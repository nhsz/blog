        <p class="text-block">Hi! This is my first blog post. I've been learning about the <strong>Go programming language</strong> lately and thought it was an interesting topic to start with.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong><a class="link" href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golang</a></strong> (as known as <em>Go</em>) is a <strong>free and open source</strong> programming language being developed by Google development since 2007. In 2012, the language reached the <a class="link" href="https://blog.golang.org/go-version-1-is-released" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.0 milestone</a>.</p>

      <h2>The best of both worlds?</h2>
      <p>Go is being designed and implemented by brilliant minds like <strong><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ken Thompson</a></strong> and <strong><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rob Pike</a></strong>, among others, in an attempt to fill the gaps where Python, Java and C++ have room for improvement.</p>
      <p>It aims to mix some of the best features from these and other modern programming languages, with a very nice balance between power and expresiveness: <strong>clear and concise syntax but still statically typed and compiled directly to machine code</strong>, <strong>high-performance and efficient code</strong>, <strong>garbage collection</strong>, <strong>native concurrency</strong> (no OS threads), etc, making it ideal to write <strong>small, focused APIs</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Simplicity</strong> and <strong>integrity</strong> are key parts of the language design. For example, you don't have to necessarily declare the type of a variable, <a class="link" href="https://tour.golang.org/basics/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type inference</a> take cares of that. Variables have a predefined <em>zero value</em> (0 for numeric types, empty for strings, <code>nil</code> for pointers, etc) so you also don't have to care about initializing them, making it less error prone.</p>

      <p>Some kind of object-orientation with functional programming features are given, but no object hierarchy or classes.</p>

      <h2>A compiled language that feels like an interpreted one</h2>
      <p>Compilation time is blazing fast; it will take ~2 seconds or less, even for large code bases. Rob Pike gives some details about this in the following interview:</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Truly cross-platform</h2>
      <p>Full cross-platform support is provided, even for <em><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plan 9</a></em> operating system (remember Ken Thompson and Rob Pike are behind the project!), you won't have any problem with that.</p>
