        <p class="text-block">Hi! This is my first blog post. I've been learning about the <strong>Go programming language</strong> lately and thought it was an interesting topic to start with.</p> 
      </div>
      
      <p><strong><a class="link" href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golang</a></strong> (as known as <em>Go</em>) is a <strong>free and open source</strong> being developed by Google development since 2007. In 2012, the language reached <a class="link" href="https://blog.golang.org/go-version-1-is-released" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.0 milestone</a>.</p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>Go is being designed and implemented by brilliant minds like <strong><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ken Thompson</a></strong> and <strong><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rob Pike</a></strong>, among others, in an attempt to fill the gaps where <code>Python</code>, <code>Java</code> and <code>C++</code> have room for improvement.</p>
      <p>It aims to mix some of the best features from these and other modern programming languages: <strong>clear and concise syntax but still statically typed and compiled directly to machine code</strong>, <strong>garbage collection</strong>, <strong>concurrency</strong>, etc. For example, you don't have to necessarily declare the type of a variable, Go uses <a class="link" href="https://tour.golang.org/basics/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type inference</a> for that.</p>
      <p>It also has some kind of object-orientation with functional programming features, but no object hierarchy or classes.</p>
      
      <h2>A compiled language that feels like an interpreted one</h2>
      <p>Compilation time is blazing fast; it will take ~2 seconds or less, even for large code bases. Rob Pike gives some details about this in the following interview:</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Truly cross-platform</h2>
      <p>Full cross-platform support is provided, even for <em><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plan 9</a></em> operating system (remember Ken Thompson and Rob Pike are behind the project!), you won't have any problem with that.</p>

      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <p>Want to learn some Go? You can start reading some free resources <strong><a class="link" href="https://github.com/nhsz/learn-go/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></strong>.</p>

      <p><em>P.S.</em>: I wrote my first Golang <strong><a class="link" href="https://github.com/nhsz/read-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">script</a></strong> and I'm using it to estimate the reading time of blog posts you see at the top :P</p>
